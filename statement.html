  <h1>"See You Soon" Installation with Digital, Mirrors </h1>
  <p>By incorporating video into reflections, I made a project that that essentially is a reflection of a self reflection. The video is a compilation of life and addiction. Life represented by the time lapse video of a flower in bloom and addiction
    represented by the endless cycle of temptation.
    The reflection that comes off the mirror is a warped version of the actual video, which speaks to the audience as a distraction of all the harm addiction provokes from the source video.

  <h1>"A to B" Digtal Video, continious shot</h1>
  <p>I attempted to recreate Andy Warhol's "Empire" piece from the early days of digital video. I loved the idea of one continious shot and wanted to apply it to something I was passionate about.</p>
